# copy the code

# Task 1 - Add comments to explain which code is in the loop and will be repeated.

  # Explain the circumstances in which the loop will run.

answer = input("What is the capital of France?")

while answer != "Paris":
  print("Incorrect! Try again.")
  answer = input("What is the capital of France?")

print("Correct!")

# Task 2
# Use the example above to ask what is the capital of Ireland

# Task 3

  # Add a line of code to the loop below that outputs an 'incorrect' message to the user and tells them what to do again.
  # Add a line of code to the loop below that lets them re-input their number
  # Add a line of code AFTER the loop below that ouputs a thank you message and repeats the number entered back to the user.  Example - 'Thank you, you typed 7'

num1 = int(input("Enter a number 10 or less"))

while num1 > 10:


# Task 4

  # Write a program that stores a secret number in a variable (you decide the number and the name of the variable)
  # The user has to guess the secret number, the program should loop until they get it right.
  # Once the user has guessed correctly they get a congratulations message
