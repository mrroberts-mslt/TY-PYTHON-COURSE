# FORK ME or copy the code!  Please don't request edit access. This is the original so it needs to stay undedited for all users.

fruit = ["Apple", "Banana", "Grape", "Strawberry", "Melon", "Orange"]

# Task 1 - easy
  # Add comments to predict what the following lines of code will do.

  # Alter the fourth print command so that it outputs a item from the list that hasn't yet been used.

print(fruit[3])

print(fruit[5])

print(fruit[0] + " " + fruit[2])

print(fruit[6])

# Task 2 - easy

# Task 3 - moderate to difficult
  # Ask the user to input a number between 0 and 5 call the variable "usernumber".
