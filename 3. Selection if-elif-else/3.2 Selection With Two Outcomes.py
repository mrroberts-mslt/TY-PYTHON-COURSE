# FORK ME or copy the code!  Please don't request edit access. This is the original so it needs to stay undedited for all users.

# Task - Predict and Run

# Add comments to the code to explain:
  # What will be output when the code is run?
  # In what circumstances would the other output message be produced

num1 = 42

if num1 == 42:
  print("You have discovered the meaning of life!")
else:
  print("Sorry, you have failed to discover the meaning of life!")


# Task Investigate and Modify

# Add to the code below so that it outputs 'You're not Dave!' if the user does not input 'Dave'

name = input("What's your name?")

if name == "Dave":
  print("Hello Dave")

# What is the condition in the code?

# How would the code work if the operator was !> ?

  #EXTRA CHALLENGE - Adapt the code so that it works in the same way but uses a not equal to Boolean operator.


# Task 3 - Make - The login checker

# Write a program that:
  # Stores the number 1337 in a variable called 'password'
  # Asks the user to guess the password and stores their input in a new variable (you choose the name)
  # If the user inputs 1337 then output 'Password correct', otherwise output 'Password incorrect'



  # Task 4 - Make 2 - Extra Challenge

  # Write a program that:
    # Asks the user to input two different numbers and stores them in two variables.
    # Outputs the biggest number entered
